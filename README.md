# Crawler
C# Crawler of Microsoft page in Wikipedia. Collects data from "History" section.

I used Html Agility Pack library in it. My IDE was Visual Studio 2019. 
Code is commented with explanations and instructions. 

Once program started you will encounter console user interface - you will need to enter count of words to display and then you will need to input words which you want to exclude from this list. When you are ready to proceed just input empty line as suggested by the interface and you will see the words and numbers of their occurrence.
